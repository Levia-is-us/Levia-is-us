Functions identified in the code:
1. get_current_location
2. main

Function: get_current_location
Signature: get_current_location(ip_address: str = None) -> dict
Parameters:
- ip_address: str (optional) - Represents the IP address for which location information is requested. If not specified, the current IP address is used.
Return Type: dict
Purpose: This function retrieves location information for a given IP address or the current IP address if not specified. It makes an API request to 'https://ipapi.co/' and returns a dictionary containing the IP address, city, region, country, and location coordinates.

Notable aspects:
- The function uses the 'requests' library to make an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint.
- It sets the 'User-Agent' and 'Accept' headers in the request.
- The function handles different scenarios such as a successful API response, API request failure, and request timeout.
- If the API request fails or times out, an error message is returned in the dictionary.

Potential issues:
- The function assumes that the API response will always be in JSON format and contain the expected keys ('ip', 'city', 'region', 'country_name', 'latitude', 'longitude'). If the API response structure changes, the function may encounter errors.

Function: main
Signature: main()
Parameters: None
Return Type: None
Purpose: This function serves as the entry point of the program. It creates an instance of the 'get_current_location' function, initializes a 'ToolRunner' object with the instance, and runs the tool.
